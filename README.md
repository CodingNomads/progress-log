# Progress Log

This repo will become an excellent source for topics for your blog posts. If something tickles your interest or boggles your mind,
take that as a writing prompt. :)

## Questions

Collect your questions in `questions.md` as a first step. Some questions will answer themselves as the course goes on.
Try to answer the rest on an ongoing basis by yourself through research as well as collaboration with your peers. [Use the course Forums](https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1477)!

## Learned Concepts

At the end of each week we will take some time to record the learned concepts of that week that stood out to you in `learned_concepts.md`.

These `.md` files are **Markdown** files. Markdown is a common format for quick, nice-looking documentation.
Learn more about how to use it [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Keep up the good work! :)
